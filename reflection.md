There is some variables like index which is very important to showing the correct days. there is a created fucntion called draw week that is then called in draw. The only conditionals used are simple ones like if key pressed and indicators. I dont think i used an array in this project. I used for loops to continue to draw different sets of data as keys were pressed. I dont think I used objects in this project.
